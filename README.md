# SkewedNews
This repository (Skewed News) is an educational homework assignment from the CARL-OTT-FSF-PT-02-20121-U-C course. It was designed to help students become more familiar with using Application Program Interfaces (API). We were tasked with designing and implementing an application using two different application program interfaces within a group setting. This was designed to mimic a project similar to a real-world scenario as a full stack web developer.

# About us
the group decided to implement an application that would draw from different news API'S and display those articles to the screen. Being that it is a news application, weather, date, and time were added as well.

## The problem
In the current political climate in most of the world, news has become increasingly biased. This application shows news sources from three different sources and displays the articles from each. The application does not attempt to solve the problem of news being biased towards one political party or another. It, however, does bring attention to the types of language and instruments of persuasion used within the news articles. Each news source has their own political leanings and its up to the user the figure out what they may be. However, to simplify things, the fox-news source is extremely right wing, the CNN news source is more neutral to right wing and the last BBC is more neutral to left. As the reader goes through each news source, they will notice the language used is politically motivated to their party of choice. Even though this is subtle and hardly noticeable at the beginning. People become persuaded over time.  

## The extra
The application provides links to the tree different news sources as well as various categories. These categories include, general, sports, health, technology, science and business. 

## Problems Encountered
Skewed News was not our first idea. We first decided to try and make an application that would help fishing tournaments. The initial problem was that fishing tournament organizers would have to call around to other organizers to see if they were fishing in the same lake. We had decided we would use a fishing API from the government that would allow organizers to see just where other tournaments would be happening and allow them to make another choice, so they did not over fish a lake. This proved to be a difficult task as the organizers need to store the information for the application to work. The local storage would not be an effective instrument and a server would be needed. WE quickly decided this was beyond the scope of the project and to much of a task for given skill-sets. 
We turned out efforts towards making the Skewed News application. The major issue for this application was finding an API that would allow us to use a key word search option. 
All the news API'S were designed to give articles and only allowed key work searches if the user signed up for a paid subscription. We eventually found a news API that allowed to search by source and this application would see the light of day.
Many of the issues within the development of the application had to do with coding. Some of the components added, conflicted with others. These issues were quickly rectified.

## Technologies used
  As a styling framework, Materialize was used. Multiple components were used, a carousel, modal, form and cards were all pulled upon.
